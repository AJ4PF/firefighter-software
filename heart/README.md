through my own poor design, i have landed myself in requirements hell..

in order to use sklearn on my M1, i had to use a conda environment which is where 'full_requirements.txt' is from. 'client/ant/requirements.txt' is the requirements necessary for running the ANT+ related code. i decided to leave in the requirements from my conda environment in case they become necessary again in the future
